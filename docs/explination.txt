Training section - loads MNIST dataset and creates neural network
    Load MNIST handwritten digits dataset
    Normalize the training and test data
    Create sequential neural network model with:
        - Flatten layer to convert 2D images to 1D
        - Two hidden layers with 128 units each using ReLU activation
        - Output layer with 10 units (for digits 0-9) using softmax activation
    Compile model with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss

    Train the model for 3 epochs
        Evaluate model performance on test data
        Save the trained model to 'handwritten_digits.model'
        Load the pre-trained model from file

Prediction section - loads custom digit images and makes predictions
    Loop through digit images in 'digits/' directory
        Load image and extract grayscale channel
       Invert colors and convert to array format
       Make prediction using the trained model
       Print the predicted digit
    Display the image
       Move to next image
       Handle errors and continue with next image
